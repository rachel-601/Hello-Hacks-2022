# Hello-Hacks-2022

This is our project for the Hello Hacks Hackathon 2022, hosted by UBC BizTech!

We designed a product that would improve online learning for students called Shuffle!

This application allows users to organize slides from a presentation based on various topics or categories (ex. topic, learning objective, etc.).
